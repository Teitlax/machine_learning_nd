my_EDA.py: just a quick analysis to have a some stats on the data

create_dataset.py: as the name says, this script will create severals dataset from the data given in input.

models.py: script for the round of models. It will create a .csv and .p file for each model in the list. Each .csv will be name (data blend) with proper information to resume the results (models, train and test logloss). These files will contain 2 columns as required by the submission format of the competition.

blender.py: last script to use. It will take in input files generated by models.py and blend them with different algorithmes. Results will once again have a proper name (datablended)and format.
